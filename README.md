# rustmojo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pkozelka/rustmojo.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pkozelka/rustmojo)

Status: experimental

This project implements part of H2O functionality in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Goals

Nearest goals are:

- parse `model.ini` (partly done)
- parse decision tree files, in binary form in versions 1.00-1.30 (done)
- dump a tree or other info (partly done)
- provide nice commandline to all included functionality (missing)
- setup complete CI using available free tools

My personal side-goal is to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
